Midterm Project for Ironhack

Wine Quality Assessment - ML Project (Linear Regression)

Group members: Dmitri Risaev & Monika Radominska

Project Goal: Investigating the impact of the physiochemical features in Portugese red and white wine quality in regards to customer rating (of wine quality) and wine choice.
We are looking at various sensory and physiochemical attributes (e.g. pH, density, sulphate levels) in wines which might influence how the customer rates the
quality of wine from 0 to 10. 

Dataset description: 
We have 2 data sets for white and red wine

@2009

White wine: 4898 rows, 11 features + dependent variable (quality 0-10)
red wine: 1599 rows, 11 features + dependent var (quality 0-10)

Project plan:
Monday: 
Data cleaning: EDA, dropping duplicates, removing typos, type conversion, dropping columns/rows, finding missing values, filling NAs, aggregation by groups

Tuesday: Check correlations, check distributions of features, divide into categ and num df if needed, check for outliers (remove if needed)


Wednesday: Starting on linear regression and ML, with data transformation, scaling, encoding, data splitting, plotting and regression 

Thursday: Preparing the presentation for Friday

Friday: Presenting
